*Datasets*

&nbsp; &nbsp; Some datasets may be found in the datsets folder of the Google Drive folder for this course. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Datasets from the KNN textbook exercises can be downloaded [here](https://netfiles.umn.edu/users/nacht001/www/nachtsheim/index.html). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Other datasets are available from [the Vanderbilt data website](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/Main/DataSets) or [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/). 

Let me know if you have other suggestions for datasets or repositories to add to this list.
